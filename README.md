# Principal parts flashcard generator

## Purpose
- This tiny python script will generate flashcards for per-part study (as opposed to studying in lists). Each “card” entry contains a part (e.g. λύσω) and an identification (e.g. second principal part of λύω, release).

## Dependencies
- Python 2
- Pandas

## Directions
- Add new principal parts to the file ```principal_parts.csv```.
- Run the script with ```python generate_flaschards.py```. Flashcards will generate in a tab-delimited csv file ```flashcards.csv```.
- Import ```flashcards.csv``` into Quizlet or another flashcard service.  My Quizlet is available [here](https://quizlet.com/_4d6rww).
